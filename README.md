This is a C library for DJGPP and Linux I wrote back in 1999. It compiles on AIX and HP-UX, too, I believe.

LibINI is a library for creating, updating and saving Windows-like INI files. It uses doubly linked lists. More about the library including an example in the [libini.txt](djgpp-libini/contrib/libini/libini.txt) file inside the [contrib/libini](djgpp-libini/contrib/libini) dir.

You can download the original package from any of the DJGPP mirrors, or from the master FTP at [ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2tk/stlini11.zip](ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2tk/stlini11.zip).
